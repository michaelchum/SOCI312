# Lecture 19

## The Big Question
Is there an Employment-Security Tradeoff?

In the US, you have more people with low tenure, it means more people just got hired on a permanent basis. In Europe, this number is lower.
In France, more people is hired on a temporary basis (for young people).
It's much easier to hire on a temporary basis in  Europe.

Corporatism: Corporations have more impact on the job market

What can Canadians learn from Europe?
In Germany, company fund all training, apprenticeship, there are a lot of laws protecting employees. However, in Sweden and Denmark (Socio-Democratic countries) taxes pay training of employees, this is corporatism, Unions are much close to companies.  

### Footnote 1 Temporary Jobs as a Reaction to Economic Uncertainty
The # of temporary workers in 06-07 vs the # of temporary workers in 11-12. Basically before and after the 09 Crisis.
There is a huge increase of temporary workers after the Crisis b/c companies want to be able to lay off workers easily in order to survive.

Other: Text - Gash - What happens to temporary workers in different context and institutions. Focus on the roles of different institutions.

## Section 10 - Low-Wage Work
Low wage work in the New Economy (1999-2000), the service based economy. 

### Context(1) Stagnating Wages
From 1948 to 1970, more productivity = more hourly compensation.
However, after 1970, the hourly wage stopped increasing porportionally to productivity.

### Context(2)
#### Change in Real Wages
For the 10th percentile lowest earners, the wage has has been constant from 1973 to 2009 (40 years).
However, the 95th percentile has increased.
#### Wage Ratio
What drove inequalities?
In 40 years, the lowest earners never had wage increase while the top earners have had significant increase in wage.

### Context(3)
1st - Lowest 20% earners
5th - Highest 20% earners
1963-1970 - A lot of good jobs are created after the end of the post-war labor market
1990-1992 - Switch from post-war labor market to the New Economy, middle-class jobs loss due to replacement by technology
1992-2000 - A lot of good jobs created but also low-wage jobs (service industries). This is the POLARIZATION of the labor market (inc. goods jobs and inc. bad jobs)

### Low-Wage Work at the Margins of the Labour Market
Large-scale surveys only takes in account those who have a phone and answer the phone. So they went on the streets to see the statistics for low-wage workers
Done after the deindustrialization (job loss in manufacturing) of the 1980s in Chicago
Employers use low-road strategies to squeeze profits
Low-road strategies - Find the cheapest workers with lowest wages and provide least benefits at the margin of the law, often minimum salaries
Basically find homeless people, illegal immigrants, temporary agency workers (daily workers on daily work contracts)
These people very often don't appear in the statistics, but they are also part of the labour market

Same daily workers in LA but with undocumented immigrants instead of homeless people
Labour intensive companies are more vulnerable to globalization, instead of outsourcing they are trying to find the cheapest employees

### Low-Wage Workers: How Many Are There and How to Count Them?
Consensus: Find the median wage and go 2/3 below this median.
If inequality is bigger, more people far from median, so more low-wage workers (~20%)
If inequality is smaller, more people close to median, so less low-wage workers (~5%)

### Measuring Poverty Using Consumer Price Levels
How to measure the poverty line?
It is the wage for minimum necessary conditions for survival

### Low-Wage Workers, Poor Workers
The Low-Wage percentage (2/3 below median wage) and poverty-wage percentage is very close in 2010.

### Low-Wage Workers Escape Poverty by Marrying
Marriage is a good way to get out of poverty even if you are earning low-wage
Most women are able to get out of poverty with marriage
Students who live with parents are mostly not in poverty when earning low-wage
Most people earning low-wage and living alone are in poverty

### Trend in Low-Wage Work, US (1979-2012)
Inequality is largest in US than anywhere in the world

### The Profile of the Low-Wage Workers (1)
Among all low-wage workers: 40.1% men 58.1% women
Having a college degree doesn't prevent low-wage (12.4% college degree holders with low-wage)
53.4% of low-wage earners are white people (but demographics: much much more white people in the US)

### (2)
Low-wage jobs sector
- 12.20% of government jobs
- 24.51% of private for-profit jobs
- 18.97% of non-profit jobs
- 8% protected by Union (good protection against low-wage income)

### (3)
Two industries account of 1/3 of the low-wage districution of work
- Retail (18.9%)
- Restaurants (12.4%)

### (4)
50.6% work in large firms of more than 500 employees
20.5% work in small companies with less than 25 employees

### Beyond Low Wages: No benefits (1)

### (2)

### Unregulated and Informal Workers
Unregulate workers survey (2008), US, huge research teams, huge funding, 3 cities: NYC, LA, Chicago
Employers can also violated the law to make more profit...
They questionaed a lot of employees to learn if they are victims of labor law violations
- 15% of wage lost over previous week
- 26% paid less than legal minimum wage
- 76% not paid the required overtime rate
- 12% had their tips stolen
- Only 8% of injured workers asked for compensation which they are entitled by law

### The Roots of Low-Wage Work (1)
The gloves-off company:

But why? (Causes)
There is a race to the bottom economy. If one company start doing lower wages, other companies have to do so as well in order to compete, otherwise costs will hinder their ability to compete.
There is more pressure to cut costs in industries like service, retail than car

Alternative explanations:
- Survival strategy from poorest households: Low-wage jobs is the only chance of survival for most poor households

### Annex: Employers Strategies (1) (2)
Strategies used by employers to reduce costs

## Lecture 20

### The Roots of Low-Wage Work (1)
- Illegal immigrants cannot go to law enforcement to get their rights enforced

### (2)
Decreasing Enforcement Resources (1975-2004)
The # of investigators decreased
The # of complicant actions decreased
The amount of back wages (money given back to workers) increased slightly

So possible explanations:
- Law enforcement is getting better (companies comply more) 
- OR Less workers complain

However, the # of workers and establishments investigations increased significantly

### (3)
Free-Falling Minimum Wage (1979-2009)
The federal minimum wage decreased while the low-wage threshold increased

### (4)
Unionization as a Predictor of Low-Wage Work
NY has the most unionized workers
Unionization is negatively correlated with low-wage work
The more unionization, the less low-wage workers

Ratchet effect: Opposite of race to the bottom. Companies who are not unionized will have trouble competing with unionized companies in hiring workers, so they have incentive to increase wages

### Taking the High Road (1)
Technological Upgrading Against Low-Wage work
IMPORTANT 
Globalization: More automation, more expertise (skills) for workers but in return, = less jobs.
HPWS (high perf. work system): Require skilled workers. In US, it's very hard to TRAIN workers b/c of poaching. But in Germany, there are company agreement where poaching is sanctioned.

### (2)
- In US, very often, the training of employees is subsidized (due to the poaching), in return company must pay workers living wages during training
- Partnership with community college
- Career ladders are re-created with redesign of jobs on the condition of training when workers acquire more responsibility. This is good for the workers' careers
- Initiatives from companies (manufacturing and health mostly) which allow workers upgrade from low-wage work (CVS management certificate for cashiers to become technicians or store manager)
This recreates the job ladder in two steps
- Several limitations, lack of confidence from employers. e.g. BEST program 2002-2004, employers opt-out after funding stopped

### (3)
How to unionize temporary workers?
Training initiatives
IMPORTANT

### (4) 
Government solution initiatives
LA - A lot of textile industry. The buyer can decide to not buy from a supplier if they have law violations. 
In California, in contracts, if the client is asking a lot from the supplier, if the supplier is violating the law, the client is ALSO accountable.
They suppose if the supply price is so low, the client would know and should suspect some wage law violation. The client is also responsible b/c they can ask for a certain supply price in the contract.
With this solution, there are more incentives for companies to use a high road strategy rather than low road strategies.

Hot goods provision solution (US law to provide incentive for self-regulation)
- Goods produced by violation with the law, will not be able to leave the state border, regardless of who is responsible. Therefore, products will never reach the market
- Targeted at apparel industry in LA and NYC 
- This forces client firms to hold their suppliers accountable and upgrade their labour practices; use of self-regulation and monitoring
- Limitation: depends on enforcement resources and inspection protocols

<<< READ NOTES FOR ESSAY & EXAM

### Taking the High Road (1)
Technological Upgrading Against Low-Wage Work

Contradiction: Might create better jobs but not more jobs
- Partnerships with educational institutions (which provide training) => Recreate job ladders

### (3)
Problem: In cleaning services / security sectors, it is filled with temporary workers on contracts, it's very hard to gather them for unions, so their wage is lower.

### (4)
"Hot goods" provision to provide incentive for self-regulation. Goods produced by labour law violations are blocked at the border forbidding exportation

### (5)
New Labour Standard Enforcement Strategies Against Low-Wage Work
- They create a Code of Conduct in NYC which was monitored, it was threatened by law enforcement
- Widespread pay and working hours violations in NYC's greengrocers
- Certification provided to compliers
- Unannounced inspector monitoring (non-governmental)

### (6)
New Labour Standard Enforcement Strategies Against Low-Wage Work
- State and Federal gov in US control minimum wage. Sometime, state governor doesn't want to inc. min. wage, the city (e.g. Seattle) increases min. wage for all government workers and contractors.

## The Big Question
Is low-wage necessary for employment performance?

Hypothesis: If employers are able to pay lower wages, they can hire more and increase productivity.

### Context: Country Profiles
- In Canada, UK, US, the share of low-wage working is much higher than European countries

### Trade Unions vs Low-Wage Work
- More low-wage work = less collective agreement (union)

### Is there an equality trade-off?
Main argument: Inequality is beneficial for growth

### Equality-Jobs Trade-off: Evidence
- Some countries guarantees high level inequality = high employment
- Some other countries low level inequality = high employment (Nordic countries)

### Alternatives to inequality
1. Public sector employment (Nordic countries)
2. Tax (payroll) and employment regulation reform
Part of what the employer pays goes to the gov' for health care, employment funds
Employees benefit from it from welfare systems
3. Increase female labour force participation (e.g. Germany, Netherland)
Remove obtstacles for women to work, maternity leave, childcare
4. Redistribution through the welfare state (taxes and transfers)

### A comparative look at income inequality

The Low-Wage Work in the Wealthy World Study (Book) Read one chapter on compensation (retail sector)
In the retail sector, why does some countries have so low low-wage workers (France) and other countries have very high low-wage workers, all in Europe?

### Analytical Framework
- Supply Side
Reservation wage = welfare amount got if not employed
Employers have to offer a lowest wage higher than the reservation wage, else a logical person would not work
- Demand Side
(Not sure) READ THE TEXT

# Section 11 - Why people are paid differently
Wage Inequality in the Knowledge Economy (Not for the Post-Ware economy)

### Defining "Skills"
1. Qualification (degree/school)
2. Learning time (how long to know how to do your job)
3. Training time (provided by the employer)
4. Tasks
5. How much you are paid (very rough proxy)

### Job Polarization and Inequality (1)

1979-1989 (Post-war economy before New Knowledge Economy)
1989-1999 Some high-paid and some low-paid jobs were created
1999-2007 

### (2)
Manager, professional, technician = increase in employment
Blue collar / white collar jobs (office/admin/production/manufacturing) = decreased lately
Some skills are paid more than others

### (3)
But if there is such an increase in high-wage jobs why are people still working in low-wage jobs?

### Relative WAge Ratio of College-Educated Workers
Why does people in high-school education went to low-wage occupations and not high-wage occupations?

### A Human Capital Perspective on Inequality in the US
You can look at inequalities by looking at the fluctuation of degrees
If there is not enough supply, employee can bargain wages
College degree holders have a much higher salary compared to high school degree holders b/c they are much more in demand

Lecture 24

### Job Polarization and Inequality (1)
High-wage and low-wage jobs have been created but much less middle-wage job

### (3)

### Relative Wage Ratio
Cause: College Degrees holders have a much higher wage than only High School degrees
This is due to technology growth required higher educated employees

### A Human Capital Perspective 
If tech grows fast and requires more tech people AND education can keep up, then jobs are stable

### Skilled-Biased Technological Change (1)
1945-1975 - Not skill-biased, technological changes were minimal, did not require major training changes
After 1975 - Computerization
Only college educated workers can use computers efficiently according to this theory
If # of tech workers stay stable but demand decrease => salary decrease

### SBTC (2)
The % of college degree holders jobs requiring the use of computers is much higher at any time
The gap in this % between college and high school is very high

### SBTC (3)
Higher education = more complex computer uses

### SBTC (4)
IT vs GDP
The share of IT in the GDP kept increasing
Steep increase in the 1990s
Computer use really increased in the later half of the 1980s
The IT increase was significant after the 50/10 ratio bumped

People argued that the technology change is not related to the increase in inequality due to their pace (timing) being different
People who think this way are "revisionist"

### Revisionst Account (2)
The increase in inequality related to decline in unionization and the minimum wage

The debate resulted that both theories are right

### The "Task Content of Jobs" Framework (1)
Reading for section 11
The demand for routine jobs (cognnitive and manual) decreased massively
The demand for non-routine jobs (cognitive-analytic and coginitive-interactive) increased massively
Routine jobs are the most replaceable by computers
e.g. Amazon warehouses are a lot of automated with machinery now. People mostly do inventories which is less routinely
Even now, they are going to have drones, so more automation

### The "Task Content of Jobs" Framework (3) or Task Framework
This framework is an extension to the skilled-biased technological change
It says college grads are best at doing NON-ROUTINE computer work, but high school grads also knows how to use a computer but for routine work

A lot of Philosophy majors in Wall Street, good speculators, analytical and interaction skills


# MIDTERM REVIEW (to prepare for FINAL)

Section 4 HPWS

5. What challenges have American and Canadian employers faced when implementing high performance work systems? Your answer must include a comparison with anoher country (as seen in class) to illustrate your point.

POINT THROUGH COMPARISON, PAY ATTENTION TO THE QUESTION
Firms tend to focus on short-term profits due to the pressure from shareholders. E.g. Germany, where employers work with the gov't to increase training to high-skilled workers. Gov't also punishes poaching. 

Lecture 25

### The "Task Content of Jobs" Framework (1)
Trends in Task Content (1959-1999)
The use of computers reduced the amount of routine jobs (white collar work mostly)
The high school educated people who lost their jobs in computerization moved to interactive computerized jobs b/c they cannot do analyticalcomputerized jobs
Some people lose their jobs (most automated sectors) some people are paid more => Polarization

### Automation and Computerisation (1)
Job requires more social intelligence => Harder to computerise
Job requires more creativity => Harder to computerise
Job requires more perception and manipulation => Harder to computerise

### (2)
Shows polarisation
Current employment ratio vs probability of computerisation
47% of people's jobs are very probably to be computerised

### Rent-Based Explanation: CEOs and Superstar Wages (1)
Rent: Something that you can keep for yourself but not accessible to otheres
Rent from the skills by making it scarce => develop rent over skills
Two mechanisms to develop rent over skills:
- Restricting the supply of workers
e.g. More people succeed at Harvard than people getting accepted into Harvard, this # of degree at Harvard is restricted,
admission is very restricted
e.g. Doctors and members of certified professional associations. This profession is restricted to those having a specific certification and the # of certification is limited.
- Rigging to their advantage wage-setting decisions
e.g. CEOs appoint the boards that decide on their pay. This leads to the board making biased decisions about the CEO's pay. This statement is biased. This statement is debated because the board is willing to hire the best CEO for a high price.

### (2)
- Research data using tax data instead of gov't surveys, this allows to look at high-earners, who are "top-coded" in most surveys
e.g. Those who earn $100k+ a year
- Found a surge in earnings of CEO and "superstar" (athletes and media stars) in the last decades in such a way that the 99.99-90 ratio accounted for a large share of the growth in earnings inequality
e.g. Only the top 10% of the distribution have wage increase greater than the increase of productivity, if their wage is growing faster than technology, it means that this increase IS NOT only due to new technology.
- In sum, this category of workers (CEOs and superstars)'s increase of salary is linked to rent instead of tech inc.

### Conference
Economy based on creativity (the creative industry, blog, writers, news) instead of manufacture, people are seeking these entertainment and the industry wants creative people. This drives inequality. Analytical skills are also incresingly important according to a lot of theories, high-level skills and management skills are very important today compared to manual skills. But are these new important skills really driving inequality? 
### Liu & Grusky: Cognitive Skills
Demand for computer skills increased significantly in Science & Engineering
In some fields, there are much bigger restrictions for practice (e.g. Engineering and Medecine) where you have to be good in order to practice, while in other fields like arts, the bar is much lower, even bad artists make a little bit of money.
There is a mass supply of creative skill, so the wage does not really increase.

2 most important elements of the text, mostly intro and conclusion
Two cases:
- Computer affect wages:
Less employees are used
- Manager discretion:

### Conclusion
Course started in 1970s

9.2
Claim: Playing with money policy (e.g. interest rate) you play with unemployment rate. E.g. Asia banks reduce interest rate to try to reduce unemployment

Higher employee protection => lower employment rate
More manufacture => higher employee protection

Third revolution
- Creative economy is more and more important

8.1 Kalleberg Job Quality in the US
5 indicator to determine a good job in the US (standard contract)
- Health insurance paid by employer
- Wage
- Pension

Looking at the share of people with these perks (standard contracts) compared to those without these perks (non-standard contracts)

Insecure workers: Changing jobs can be good but overtime, it's not.
